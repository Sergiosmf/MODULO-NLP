    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Como usar o sistema melhorado:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sistema Básico (Estável):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Consulta padrão\n",
    "resposta = rag_system.query(\"Seus direitos como consumidor\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sistema Aprimorado (Recomendado):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Consulta com melhorias (cache, expansion, re-ranking)\n",
    "resposta = rag_system.enhanced_query(\"Como devolver produto com defeito?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLaMA 3.2 (Avançado):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Execute diagnóstico primeiro para verificar status\n",
    "# Troca temporária para LLaMA 3.2 se disponível\n",
    "original = rag_system.generator\n",
    "rag_system.generator = llama_legal_generator\n",
    "resposta = rag_system.query(\"Pergunta complexa\")\n",
    "rag_system.generator = original  # Restaurar\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 🔍 Problemas Identificados e Corrigidos:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **❌ PROBLEMA:** LLaMA 3.2 não sendo detectado na comparação\n",
    "   **✅ SOLUÇÃO:** Correção de escopo de variáveis (`locals()` → `globals()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **❌ PROBLEMA:** Respostas template repetitivas para defeitos\n",
    "   **✅ SOLUÇÃO:** Templates específicos para cada tipo de consulta\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **❌ PROBLEMA:** Score de relevância baixo (2.7/5)\n",
